  <h1>"Did you know?"</h1>
  <p>
Did you know it takes around eight to nine minutes for the Suns light to reach the Earth.
The distance from the Sun to the Earth is about 150 million km.
The light travels at 3 hundred thousand km per second, so dividing it it by the other gives you 500 seconds.
The energy can reach Earth in mere minutes.
Though it takes millions of years to travel from the Sun's core to the surface.

<h1> Sun's temperature </h1>
<p>
  Temperatures inside the Sun can reach 15 million degrees (celsius).
  Energy is generated through the nuclear fusion in the Sun's core.
  The hyddrogen converts to helium, and because the objects generally expand, the Sun would blow up like a ticking time bomb if it wasn't for the tremendous gravitational pull.
  The Sun does not have an official scientific name, though it is referred to as "Sol" at times.
  The name comes from the ancient Roman's god of the Sun.
  The alternate name is where we get the terms solar system, which literally means system of the Sun.
