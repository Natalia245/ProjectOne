  <h1>Sun Facts</h1>
  <body>
<p>The Sun over is 99.86% of the mass in the solar system.
It has mass around 330,000 times of mass then Earth.
Over one million Earth's can fit in the Sun.
If the Sun was hollow with thousands of Earth's inside of it, around 960,000 spherical Earths would be inside of the Sun.
However, if you mashed the Earths together with no space in between, it would be around 1,300,000 Earths inside the Sun.

<p> Some day the Sun will consume the Earth.
Once the Sun burns through all of its hydrogen, it will burn through helium.
During that time, it will expand to such a size that it will begin to "absorb" Venus, Mercury and eventually the Earth.
After it reaches this point, it will become a huge red star.
It will also, eventually be around the size of Earth as well.</P>
