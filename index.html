  <h1>Sun Mass</h1>
  <body>
<p> The Sun is what's believed to be a sequence star.
It's a sphere composed of two gases.
Those gases are hydrogen and helium.
The exact range is debatable,
although it is believed to approximately 1.4 x 10^29 kg and 2.0 x 10^32 kg.
It's described to be at least 75 times the mass of Jupiter.</P>
<h1> Sun Size </h1>
<p> The size of the Sun, compared to the largest known stars, is not very big.
Though, if it is compared to common types of stars in the universe, like the red dwarf, the Sun is bigger.
Note, the Sun is not the biggest type of star.
But it is quite bigger then most.
The Sun itself contains 99.8% of the total mass in the Solar System.</P>
